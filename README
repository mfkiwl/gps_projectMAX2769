This is the academic gps project. Our main goal - create the board with open architecture, create the software under opensource. Board will send gps in raw format into network via USB (but via RS232) interface and server-side software
(perhaps via PCI bus directly into a PC). Any client can connect to the gps-board and get a raw data. Mainly project orient for an university DSP-course.

First version of the board will contain
			Hardware:
				onboard RS-232 port and the management VHDL		[done]
				256K SRAM memory and the SRAM controller in VHDL	[done]
				GPS chip arbiter					[done]

			Software:
				correlation code on C under Linux			[none]
				GPS-satellite signal generator				[unknown]
				RS232 client in C under Linux				[in progress]
				GUI for software modules				[in progress]


Stage: we are near the revision 1.0 of the board. At this moment we have board, correlator on the matlab and some usefull scripts
